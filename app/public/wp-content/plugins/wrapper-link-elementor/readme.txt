== Description ==

Elementor Link Wrapper allow you to place custom links into sections and columns on Elementor. You can choose the link implementation method and you can also use dynamic links for internal links.

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between HTML and JS implementation methods? =

On the HTML implementation method, after setting the link a <a> tag will be created as the wrapper parent. On JS, the link redirect will be set through jQuery (onclick() method).

= Which link settings are being transported to the frontend? =

On link settings, you can set multiple features: Link in new tab or not (target), nofollow, custom values and others.
At this time, the plugin will only read the target setting, not the others.
